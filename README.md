# E-Farming mobile application using flutter

This system facilitates all the human inquiries regarding that farming field, also its very simple application that is designed meeting the friendly user interface to facilitate usage of its function. “E-Farming” system has multiple quite interesting functions for users such as: 
* Argo-Market : An online marketplace that allows the user to easily buy light and heavy agricultural supplies, in addition to fertilizers and seeds. 
*  Plant diseases detection : A Function through which the user can know the type of plant disease by photographing or uploading a picture of the plant, and the program through that image determines the type of plant and the percentage of the disease.
* Soil picker : A Function through which the user can know the type of plant that can be chosen for his type of soil by photographing or uploading a picture of the soil, and the program through that image determines the type of soil and the plant that is best to be planted in this type of soil.
* farming guide : A function that helps the users who are beginners in farming, to know more details and help them in planting. The user can choose or search for the fruit or vegetables the want to know about and can save them by pressing the interest button.
* Diseases guide : function helps the users know more details about the diseases, what caused the disease, how to cure the disease “chemically & organically” and recommend for user some products to cure the disease.
* For you : Customized function for users to give them spacified plan for them to meet their level in farming field.

## Technology and techniques

Technquies and technologies overview: CNN, Keras, TensorFlow, Flutter, dart programming language, Machine learning, Firebase.
To Build CNN use some popularly used open-source libraries: 

* TensorFlow: is the most used open-source library to develop models in deep learning. It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training of deep neural networks.
* Keras: a high-level API to build and train deep learning models Runs on top of TensorFlow models. Because to preform computations and math operations.

For Our Application UI & UX we used:
* Dart: an object-oriented programming language for apps on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile, desktop, server, and web applications.
* Flutter: an open-source mobile application development framework created by google. It is used to develop applications for Android and iOS, as well as being the primary method of creating applications for Google.
* Firebase: is a platform developed by Google for creating mobile and web applications. It was originally an independent company founded in 2011. In 2014, Google acquired the platform and it is now their flagship offering for app development we used it to store data within the application.

## Two CNN Models

Plant disease detection and soil picker are created by machine learning cinvlutional neural network concepts and here are links to the two models compilation and creation in ditails:
